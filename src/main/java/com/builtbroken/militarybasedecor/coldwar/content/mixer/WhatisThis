I am planning to copy the blast compressor from blastcraft,
rename and change the textures and create a new block called: CementMixer
which will be used to create concrete.
this will be a more complex crafting system, that makes sense as to how concrete
is made! The recipe for concrete will be to combine water with cement (separate recipe in crafting table) in the cement
mixer.
